+# Acropolis Adaptive Expert Platform
 
+Acropolis is a modular research platform for building and orchestrating "expert" agents.
+It is organized as a Rust workspace with optional components for native plugins,
+embeddings, and a desktop GUI.
+
+## Orchestrator
+* Routes JSON tasks to registered agents through an asynchronous channel.
+* Limits concurrent tasks and records execution metrics.
+* Initializes subsystems for lifecycle management, monitoring, multi-tier cache,
+  a websocket server, and optional mesh networking.
+* Supports hot-reloading of native plugins with configurable security.
+
+## Agent System
+* `Agent` trait defines name, type, capabilities, request handling, and health checks.
+* Built-in agents:
+  * **EchoAgent** – returns the provided input for testing.
+  * **HashEmbeddingAgent** – generates deterministic embeddings for text.
+  * **PythonToolAgent** – executes whitelisted Python scripts with path, argument,
+    and hash validation.
+  * **LlmAgent** – uses `llama_cpp` for text generation when the `with-llama` feature is enabled.
+* `AgentFactory` can create agents by type (echo, python, optional Julia/Zig/LLM).
+
+## Memory Subsystem
+* Stores `MemoryFragment` structures containing content, embeddings, metadata, and tags.
+* Generates embeddings via an embedding agent and caches them to avoid recomputation.
+* Provides vector similarity search with reranking and an in-memory key-value store.
+
+## Plugin Framework
+* Loads native agents from shared libraries (`.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`).
+* Enforces extension allowlists, file-size limits, and hash allowlists before loading.
+* Watches the plugin directory for changes to reload updated agents.
+* Example plugin `uppercase_plugin` converts text to uppercase.
+
+## Configuration
+* `Settings` load defaults from `config.toml`, optional local files, and environment variables.
+* Environment variables with the `AEP_` prefix override critical fields such as server host,
+  port, plugin directory, observability endpoints, and security secrets.
+* Validation ensures sane values (e.g., non-zero server port, plugin directory existence).
+
+## GUI
+* Tauri-based desktop application that wraps the orchestrator.
+* Loads task definitions from the `configs` directory and exposes them to the frontend.
+* Executes tasks via commands such as `execute_task` and `list_tasks`.
+
+## Development
+Run `cargo test` to build and test the workspace. Some optional features (e.g., Julia
+integration) require additional system dependencies.
