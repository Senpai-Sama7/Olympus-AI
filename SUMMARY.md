## Introduction

Olympus AI is a sophisticated, full-stack enterprise web application designed for robust product management, secure user administration, and intelligent document processing. Built with a modern microservices architecture, it combines a powerful backend, a dynamic frontend, and advanced AI/ML components to deliver a scalable, secure, and highly efficient platform.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Secure User & Administrative Management
*   **Comprehensive User Lifecycle:** Supports user registration, secure login (with JWT and refresh tokens), password updates, and profile management.
*   **Advanced Security:** Implements account lockout for brute-force protection, robust password hashing (bcrypt), CSRF and XSS prevention, rate limiting, and secure HTTP headers.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Differentiates between `user` and `admin` roles, ensuring granular access to features and data.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Provides administrators with tools to manage all users, including viewing, deleting, and updating user roles, alongside system-wide statistics.

### 2. Comprehensive Product Lifecycle Management
*   **Full CRUD Operations:** Enables seamless creation, reading, updating, and deletion of product information.
*   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Users can efficiently search for products by name or description, and filter results by category, price range, and stock availability.
*   **Product Ownership:** Products are associated with their creators, allowing for user-specific product listings.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Utilizes multi-tier caching (in-memory and Redis) and database indexing to ensure fast product retrieval and updates.

### 3. Intelligent Document Retrieval & Ingestion
*   **AI-Powered Search:** Features a dedicated retrieval service that can understand natural language queries and find the most relevant document chunks using vector similarity search (powered by `pgvector`).
*   **Automated Document Ingestion:** A robust workflow (built with Temporal) automates the process of:
    *   Fetching raw documents from a source.
    *   Intelligently chunking large documents into smaller, manageable pieces.
    *   Generating numerical embeddings (vector representations) for each chunk.
    *   Storing these chunks and their embeddings in a specialized database for efficient retrieval.
*   **Real-time Event Streaming:** A Rust-based control plane allows clients to submit tasks (like document ingestion) and receive real-time updates on their progress via gRPC and Redis Streams.

### 4. Controlled Automation & Interaction (NEW)
*   **Controlled Local Code Execution:** Provides a secure, sandboxed environment to execute custom code snippets (Python, Node.js, Bash) locally. This enables automation of complex tasks, data processing, and custom integrations within a safe, isolated workspace.
*   **Controlled Web Interaction:** Allows programmatic browsing and interaction with external websites. This includes navigating, clicking, typing, extracting data, uploading/downloading files, and managing sessions, all within a controlled and auditable headless browser environment.

### 5. Robust & Scalable Architecture
*   **Microservices Design:** The system is composed of independent, loosely coupled services (Node.js backend, React frontend, Python retrieval, Temporal workflows, Rust control plane), promoting scalability, resilience, and easier development.
*   **Containerization:** All services are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent environments from development to production.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Leverages asynchronous programming models and message queues (Redis Streams, Temporal) for efficient, non-blocking operations.
*   **Observability:** Integrated with structured logging (Winston), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger), and health checks for comprehensive monitoring.

### 6. Modern User Experience
*   **Intuitive Frontend:** A responsive and dynamic React application provides a smooth and engaging user interface.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** Integrates toast notifications for immediate user feedback on actions and errors.
