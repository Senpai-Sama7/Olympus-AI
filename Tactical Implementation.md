# Tactical Implementation Mode — Full Creative Set + Behavioral Segmentation

I built this to drop straight into production. It follows the Decision-Trinity + 6-Phase Universal Message Architecture, then packages the assets you asked for: copy, wireframes, offer/pricing matrix, and a deeper behavioral segmentation map. &#x20;

---

## Psychological foundation (why this works — one paragraph per lever)

* **Loss aversion math**: people weigh losses more than equivalent gains, so we quantify the cost of inaction early and often (Prospect Theory; “losses loom larger than gains”). ([ScienceDirect][1], [Wikipedia][2])
* **Asymmetric dominance (decoy effect)** nudges buyers toward the target plan in a Good–Better–Best grid. ([The Decision Lab][3])
* **Zero-price + foot-in-the-door**: a truly risk-free micro-commitment exploits the zero-price effect and consistency bias to propel the next “yes.” ([Massachusetts Institute of Technology][4], [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston][5], [Bulidomics][6])
* **Short-video proof first**: attention decays quickly; we front-load a ≤60-sec demo with captions to maximize completion and transfer belief. ([Wistia][7], [Chief Marketer][8])
* **Pattern-interrupt → framing → identity**: we seize attention, reassign meaning, and align with self-image (Pattern Architect approach).&#x20;

# A) Deeper Behavioral Segmentation Map

> Use this to choose hooks, proof, and offers by **motivation**, not just demographics. Each segment gets its own bias levers, micro-commitment, and CTA.

| Segment (working name)                   | Core Job-to-Be-Done                    | Status Anxiety / Primary Fear   | Default Mental Model                   | Bias Levers to Pull                        | Proof that Converts                        | Micro-Commitment                           | Primary Channel(s)              |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Risk-Guardian** (Ops/CISO/Finance)     | Eliminate hidden risk & variance       | Being blamed for avoidable loss | “If it isn’t measured, it isn’t real.” | Loss aversion; authority; default options  | Benchmarks + peer logos + audit-ready KPIs | **Free Risk Scan** (auto report in 10 min) | LinkedIn + email nurture        |
| **Throughput Maximizer** (RevOps/PM)     | Hit output targets with same headcount | Missing the quarter             | “Bottlenecks are everywhere.”          | Endowment effect (your data); social proof | 60-sec before/after process demo           | **ROI Calculator** saving to PDF           | Product-led trial + retargeting |
| **Career Elevator** (VP/Founder)         | Visible wins that travel up-stack      | “Am I ahead of the curve?”      | “Winners spot patterns early.”         | Scarcity; identity; authority signals      | Press mentions + marquee case              | **15-min Executive Briefing** slot         | Direct outreach + events        |
| **Skeptical Pragmatist** (Senior IC)     | Less hassle, fewer tickets             | Tool fatigue                    | “Prove it in my environment.”          | Foot-in-the-door; zero-price               | Side-by-side in their stack                | **90-min sandbox** with sample data        | Developer communities           |
| **Cost Surgeon** (Procurement/SMB Owner) | Lower all-in cost without risk         | Overpaying for fluff            | “Price is signal of waste.”            | Decoy effect; anchored ROI                 | TCO worksheet + alternatives map           | **Price-match + 90-day ROI**               | Search/PPC + pricing page       |

*Notes:* Anchor your funnel KPIs per segment (e.g., Risk-Guardian → scan completion rate; Skeptical Pragmatist → sandbox activation). Build personas from ongoing VoC and analytics; refresh quarterly.&#x20;

---

# B) Offer / Pricing Matrix (Good–Better–Best + Risk Reversal)

> Design choice architecture so “Professional” feels inevitable. Pre-select it; default to annual; show ROI per plan.&#x20;

| Plan                            | For          | What they get                                         | Psychological role        | List / Annual (MO) | Risk-Reversal Pledge                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**                       | Solo/Trial   | Core features, community, email support               | **Anchor** (cheap decoy)  |        \$99 / \$79 | 30-day refund                                                                               |
| **Professional** (Most Popular) | Team growth  | All Basic + automation + SSO + priority support       | **Target** (pre-selected) |      \$299 / \$249 | **90-day Performance Guarantee**: hit \[specific metric] or full refund **+ \$500** credit. |
| **Enterprise**                  | Complex env. | All Pro + SOC2 add-on, custom SLA, specialist rollout | **Price umbrella**        |      \$999 / \$849 | **Implementation Guarantee**: live in \[timeframe] or we finish it free.                    |

* Add real **capacity windows** (“Q4 cohort: 27 slots remaining”) and **cohort start dates** for urgency. Scarcity must be auditable.&#x20;
* Decoy/anchoring and risk-free entry points are supported by behavioral science (decoy effect; zero-price; FITD). ([The Decision Lab][3], [Massachusetts Institute of Technology][4], [Bulidomics][6])

# C) Full Creative Set (copy you can ship)

## 1) Landing Page Copy (long-form, skimmable)

**Hero (Pattern-Interrupt):**
“83% of teams like yours are leaking $\[X]/week to \[status-quo]. If you’re fighting \[problem], stop. There’s a faster pattern.”
*Subhead:* “See \[Outcome] in **90 minutes**—in your environment—or we pay you \$500 for trying.”
*CTA buttons:* **Start free risk scan** • **See 60-sec demo**.&#x20;

**Section 1 — Quantified Loss (Loss Aversion):**
“Every \[unit of work] costs you $\[A] in \[hidden metric] + $\[B] in \[compound risk]. That’s **$\[annual]** you’re transferring to \[competitor/problem].” (Calculator widget.)

**Section 2 — Authority-Backed Teaching (1 idea):**
“Top performers **invert** \[conventional step]. Here’s the 3-step pattern to reclaim \[Outcome].” (1 diagram + 3 bullets + source tag.)

**Section 3 — 60-sec Proof Video (Show, don’t tell):**
Before/after in a live account with captions; no sound required; focus on time-to-value. ([Wistia][7])

**Section 4 — Social Proof Cascade:**

* *Stats:* “23,847 professionals implemented this.”
* *Logos:* \[peers]
* *Quote:* “We cut \[metric] by 34% in 21 days.”
* *Credibility tags:* e.g., “Featured in \[credible outlet].”
  (Structure per Universal Message Architecture.)&#x20;

**Section 5 — Offer Snapshot (Good–Better–Best):** table + “Most Popular” chip + annual default.

**Section 6 — Risk Reversal Bar:**
“90-day performance guarantee or \$500 bonus for your time.” (Link to terms.)

**Section 7 — FAQ (Objection handling):**

* “What if we’re different?” → “Your data, your environment, 90 min.”
* “How is this not another tool?” → “See the before/after in 60 sec.”
* “Security?” → SOC2, DPIA, data boundaries.

**Sticky Footer CTA:** **Start free risk scan** (no CC) • **Book 15-min briefing**.

> All sections mirror NACS Phases 1–6: Pattern-Interrupt → Loss → Authority → Proof → Social Proof → Risk-Free Step.&#x20;

---

## 2) Email Sequence (5 touches over 8 days)

1. **Day 0 — Loss Amplification**
   *Subject:* “You’re losing $\[X]/week to \[status-quo].”
   *Body:* one-screen breakdown + 1-click **Start Risk Scan**.
2. **Day 2 — Authority Teaching**
   *Subject:* “The counterintuitive move top teams make.”
   *Body:* 1 insight + 45-sec proof clip.
3. **Day 4 — Peer Pressure Activation**
   *Subject:* “\[Peer] just did this—see their numbers.”
   *Body:* mini case + trial defaults to **Professional**.
4. **Day 6 — Value Anchoring**
   *Subject:* “Your ROI if you push go this quarter.”
   *Body:* calculator link; save PDF.
5. **Day 8 — Scarcity Close**
   *Subject:* “Final \[N] spots in the Q\[ ] cohort.”
   *Body:* authentic capacity constraints + instant booking.&#x20;

---

## 3) Ads & Retargeting

**LinkedIn (title-case, B2B status + pain):**

* “VPs of Sales: Your pipeline leaked \$287k last quarter. Here’s why.”
* “CTOs: Tech debt just became technical liability.”
  *Body:* 1 authority insight + peer proof + **risk-free scan** CTA.&#x20;

**Meta/TikTok (≤20 sec short):** cold hooks → calculator → demo frame → CTA. Add captions; design for mute. ([Wistia][7])

**Retargeting (endowment effect):**

* “Your free assessment found **17 issues**—lock remediation?”
* “Your ROI calc shows **\$340k** potential—reserve your slot?”&#x20;

---

## 4) Sales Conversation Spine (SPIN-Challenger hybrid)

* **S:** “How many \[relevant units] per week? What’s the current throughput metric?”
* **P:** “Where do misses or delays occur? What’s the ‘oh-no’ moment?”
* **I (teach):** “Here’s the pattern top performers use to prevent that. Let me show your numbers.”
* **N:** “If we remove \[bottleneck], what does that unlock by Q\[ ]?”
* Close with **risk-reversed micro-commitment** (90-min sandbox), not a full contract.&#x20;

# D) Wireframes (textual, developer-ready)

> These are intentionally “opinionated” to map 1:1 with the copy and behavioral levers.

### WF-1: Landing (Conversion-First)

```
[Top Bar] Logo | Nav (Why it Works, Pricing, Proof) | CTA: Start Risk Scan

[Hero] H1 (Pattern-Interrupt) + Subhead (90-min promise) + 2 CTAs
       Right: 60-sec demo embed (autoplay muted, captions)

[Loss Calc] Short form (3 inputs) → dynamic $loss + chart → CTA

[Authority Teaching] 3-step diagram + “as seen in [credible]” chips

[Proof Stack] Logo strip → 3 quotes → stat bar

[Pricing Snapshot] Good–Better–Best table (Pro pre-selected)

[Risk-Reversal Bar] Guarantee copy + link to terms

[FAQ Accordion] 6 objections → crisp answers

[Footer] Security badges, compliance links, contact
```

### WF-2: Pricing

```
[Header] Outcome-focused headline + reminder of annual savings

[Plan Cards] Basic | Professional (Most Popular) | Enterprise
             Each: outcomes bullets → toggle Monthly/Annual (default Annual)
             Below: ROI per plan (auto from calc)

[Guarantees] Performance + Implementation matrix

[FAQ] Pricing & procurement specifics
```

### WF-3: “Start Risk Scan” (Lead-to-Value)

```
[Step 1] Email + SSO | [Step 2] Data source pick | [Step 3] Run scan (progress)
[Result] Personalized report: Issues (ranked), $impact, next 3 actions
[CTA] “Activate fix in 90 minutes” (books cohort slot)
```

Creative pacing aligns with attention mechanics (pattern interrupt; short demo; chunking).&#x20;

---

# E) Implementation Velocity

* **Day 1–2:** Wire landing page (WF-1), embed demo; set calculator; ship copy above.
* **Day 3:** Set **Good–Better–Best** with “Pro” pre-selected; wire guarantees & terms.
* **Day 4:** Launch 5-touch email + LI cold ads; retargeting pixels on.
* **Day 5:** Sales plays live; book 90-min sandbox slots (capacity banner).&#x20;

---

# F) Optimization Protocols (what to measure & how to iterate)

* **Leading:** Hero video completion ≥ 55% (≤60-sec clips), calculator interaction rate ≥ 25%, micro-commitment start ≥ 18%. If short-video engagement lags, compress first 3 seconds to show the outcome. ([Wistia][7])
* **Mid-funnel:** Professional plan selection ≥ 65% of paid trials (decoy working), sandbox-to-paid ≥ 35%. If “Basic” cannibalizes, reduce its perceived value or increase Enterprise to strengthen the umbrella. ([The Decision Lab][3])
* **Lagging:** CAC payback ≤ 3 months; 90-day guarantee claim rate ≤ 5%; cohort slots fill ≥ 90% 48h pre-start.
* **IR/exec view (optional):** publish KPI glossary + cohort bridges for trust with stakeholders.&#x20;

---

## Ethical boundaries (built-in)

* Scarcity = **real** (dated cohorts; cap slots).
* Guarantees = **audited** results windows; terms in plain English.
* Proof = **verifiable** (no synthetic logos).&#x20;

---

## What you’ll get if we tailor to your product next

* Swap placeholders with your true loss math and KPI taxonomy (we can mirror your analytics).
* Re-score segments using your VoC + behavior data (JTBD survey + cohort analysis).&#x20;

If you want, paste your product, top 3 outcomes, and 2–3 competitor claims—I’ll instantly slot them into the copy above and adjust the pricing/guarantee language to fit your economics.

Awesome—switching into full build mode. I’m going to assume the product we’re taking to market is **Olympus AI** (open-source, production-ready agentic AI platform) and tailor everything below to that positioning. If you meant a different product, I’ll refit this on the fly.

# Creative Set (ready to ship)

## 1) Landing page copy (final draft)

**Hero (pattern-interrupt):**
**Stop shipping prompt hacks. Start shipping production agents.**
*subhead:* Build, deploy, and manage agentic workflows, RAG pipelines, and full observability in one place—without duct-taping tools. Start free. ([Olympus AI][1])
*primary CTAs:* **Start Free Sandbox** • **Watch 60-sec Demo**

**Credibility line:** Open-source platform used to build production-ready agentic AI, with native RAG, integrations, and monitoring. ([Olympus AI][1])

**Section: The cost of staying “prototype-only” (loss aversion calculator)**

* Inputs: #apps planned this quarter • avg. eng hours per app • infra/tooling line items
* Output: **Hours and \$ burned** in hand-built orchestration, brittle retrieval, and missing observability.

**Section: How Olympus AI changes the game (authority teaching)**

* **Orchestrate agents & flows visually** (LLM, retrieval, tools, HTTP, code nodes), then ship.
* **RAG done right**: manage knowledge bases, test recall, swap vector DBs, and iterate quickly.
* **Observability built-in**: logs, annotation, evaluation loop.
* **Deploy your way**: cloud or self-host via Docker/Helm. ([Olympus AI Docs][2])

**Proof (60-sec muted demo)**

* Hook: “Prototype → Production in one canvas.”
* Show: create workflow → attach knowledge → add tool → run → inspect logs → publish API. (Captions only; outcome in first 3 seconds.)

**Plan snapshot (Good–Better–Best)**

* **Sandbox (Free):** 200 message credits, 1 workspace. *Explore risk-free.*
* **Professional (Most Popular):** 5k credits/mo, 3 members, 50 apps, unlimited logs.

  Toggle annual default (save 17%). ([Olympus AI][3])

**Risk-reversal bar (proposed, add terms):**
“Spin up a **90-minute AI Readiness Scan**. If you can’t stand up a working agentic flow in that window, we’ll gift you \$500 in credits.” *(Your internal guarantee; not an existing Olympus AI policy.)*

**FAQ (objection handling)**

* **Can we self-host?** Yes—Docker & Helm supported. ([Olympus AI Docs][2])
* **Does it work with our models?** OpenAI, Anthropic and more; switch/compare globally. ([Olympus AI Docs][2], [Olympus AI][1])
* **RAG flexibility?** Multiple retrieval and indexing methods; major vector DBs supported. ([Olympus AI Docs][2])
